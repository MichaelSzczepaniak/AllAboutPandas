# AllAboutPandas

This purpose of this project is to create a quick reference to wrangling pandas dataframes in Python. It is intended to help people (like me) who have had to bounce between working in R and Python and need a reminder of how to perform various operations in pandas. It is not a substitute for taking a good class on pandas, but rather as a reminder or refresher on pandas operations that you may not have used in awhile.
